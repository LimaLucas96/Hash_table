## Introduction

A table of dispersion (Hash_table) is a very popular way of organizing a table of symbols. It can be said that scatterplots are a generalization of the idea of ​​direct addressing. They were invented to work well on average, that is, in most cases; its worst-case performance is unfortunate.

The implementation of a scatter table involves many subtleties that affect its efficiency, although they do not affect its correctness.
